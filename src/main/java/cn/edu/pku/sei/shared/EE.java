 * This class is a dummy type. You do not need to modify it. 
 * We use this type to satisfy the Graph's need  for a specific type parameter
 * for the generic edge data element. We use ths type 
 * only when instancing Graph for use with 
 * Maze. Maze does not require edge data other than the weight, so it doesn't
 * actually use this field.  
 * Even so, we still need to assign a type parameter 
 * to be able to instance the generic class.,
